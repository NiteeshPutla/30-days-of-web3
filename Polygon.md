Polygon is a layer2 scaling solution for ethereum which utilizes sidechains for offchain data computation.


why would a developer choose to build on polygon?
building on ethereum would be costly so sidechains like polygon were created speed up blockchain while making minimal sacrifices to the security and decentralization thus 
an improved userexperience and reduced network congestion.
